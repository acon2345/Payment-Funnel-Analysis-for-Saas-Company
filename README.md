## Executive Summary:

The company has recognized that a significant number of subscriptions remain unpaid, indicating an obstacle in the online payment process, which has greatly impacted revenue negatively.
This analysis examines and identifies pain points within the online payment process and supply actionable recommendations to improve the converstion rate of successful payments.
Using SQL and a data science notebook to build a payment funnel analysis, I recommend the following be implemented to achieve the desired conversion rate:

1. 3rd party collaboration to indentify and devise a plan to resolve pain points
2. Reminder emails/texts/notifications to complete payment process
3. Utilizing technology to combat user error in payment method process


## Business Problem:

The finance team has recognized that many subscriptions haven't been paid which indicate a breakdown within the online payment process. For the desired conversion rate to be achieved, the product team must discover what friction points in the online payment process exist and what adjustments can be made to encourage users to successfully complete the online payment process.
